YAOWN - yet another wallet app

Welcome to the world.

Every human being is an investor. You too. We invest our time and our money. The economic system, and nature before it, makes us investors.
This application is designed to help you on your way to a carefree life, where you keep track of the things that help you and your family.
It's about realising that all the decisions you make today have the potential to have a lasting impact on your life.

The two things are money and time.

Money is fleeting and time is always moving forward. If you realise today that the money you have today and earn over time forms a basis for what your life will look like over the course of 40-50 years.

Since we can't escape this, you should take a moment to become aware of it. 5 minutes for 50 years.

This app is designed to help you realise where you are today and what you can do today to help you and your family achieve a retirement worthy of the name over the decades.

It's important to know where you're spending your money and what you can do to use some of it in a way that will help you achieve greater endurance and freedom in the future.

It's not hard to keep track. Just start to realise that it is not necessary to limit your life and still take responsibility for your future.

We would like to help you with this. Let's start together. Very small at the beginning and with time it will become easier and easier for you to make the right decisions and move towards the goal of a relaxed old age.

Your YAOWN team.
